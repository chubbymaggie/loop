This example shows how to use LOOP.

1. Compile mytest1.c
   gcc -g -m32 mytest1.c -o mytest1

2. Run Pin to get a trace
   make trace
   The program needs an input, type "3" then enter.

3. Make a concrete trace
   make con

4. Filter the trace
   make filter

5. Preprocess
   make pre_process

6. Symbolic execution
   ./run_se.sh

7. run STP solver
   ./run_stp.sh
